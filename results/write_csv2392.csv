"Automatically try and extract stats like passes, forward passes, pass success rate, meters run etc per player",1123⬆ | 82⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 6:25 AM","You cannot see the shirt number, we have no trackers, body size and width?","Som clubs are obligated to do this by using other tools i.e Wyscout. I agree, this could be a nice feature - but when some club are obligated to use other systems for this - i guess you should consider this as an extra payable add-on/feature to the platform.","We currently pay a Veo subscription to host our videos, then turn around and pay Huld to host those same videos so we can use hudl assist for stats. This would be huge and an opportunity for Veo to increase revenue.","Yup, player stats would be amazing. I don’t know if this is something that can be automated as yet but if it can be done, it really should be.",want to see the last login date from a player,"Being able to generate stats by tagging players would even be helpful. A bit more of a manual process, but I’m tagging players in highlights anyways. It’d be nice to have historical stats for shots attempted / goals scored",How do we get progress on the roadmap? I love this idea and really would add so much over the competitor products but its been in the works for a LONG time now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In case the video is started before the match would start, it’d be a great option to have the ability to trim the recording.",1056⬆ | 63⬇,"Sep 18, 2020 1:21 PM",,,,,I agree with all the above commments. Please could you implement a trim tool ASAP? Thanks,,,"Must have feature, pretty poor that after all this time such an easy fix hasn’t been implemented.",We had a bad injury that required ambulance etc. recording the poor kid the entire time. I should be able to mark a start and stop event that at least removes this section from being viewable by others than admins.,"I have to agree with the various commentors that this is not a hard feature to implement. A bit of Google searching can turn up working ffmpeg command line and code examples. Not having this ability for the cases described above, forces Veo customers to download the video from Veo’s platform, edit it and host it elsewhere, where Veo is no longer given market visibility.",Please please please take care of this feature or at least respond to it with some rationale for why it’s not achieveable!,The Android App problems last week caused a 3 hour delay when I hit “STOP RECORDING” There are 3 hours of video sitting in my house . I have to be able to trim this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like to follow one specific player. This would be really valuable when(as a coach) having progressive talks and giving feedback to players.,863⬆ | 82⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 6:41 AM",,,,,How do we get updates on these? They are such massive features but its been three years now i think looking at the dates?,,,,,,,,Great Idea. Thanks!,This would be fantastic.,And the referee if possible,Wondering what update is here? Using my VEO 2 for a couple clubs and high school team and my son’s club team uses Trace which has the wearable to track each player and its super helpful!,"Agreed! Tracking specific player would be very useful.
VEO, please get on it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instead of individually downloading each highlight have the facilty to have one video downloaded containing all the highlights,578⬆ | 31⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 7:15 AM",,,,,"You can download all highlights, but the name doesnt work. Ideally I’d like to be able to name the download, or if you could concatenate all the tags into the filename.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Please make it possible to choose wich highlights you want to download as one file. There can be a lot of highlights but maybe I just want a file with all the goals ;o) Therefore - please make it possible to click which highlights that comes in one download ;o),"I agree. I would be nice to download all highlights. One option: As one film, the other option: simply all highlights as one download (but they stay seperately)",I really would like to be able to download all highlights into one video or be able to select which highlights to merge together. I’m really disappointed that I’m not able to do this.,Can you please provide an update on the status of this request.,Seems like they have tried to implement something along this line… https://veo.nolt.io/7. What is missing from it is the selecting of which highlights to download.,"Hey guys,
is there any update on this? It would be really great to have this possibility. Our club (5th tier Austria) has a request from our league, to provide the highligts for a local TV-show. The league is fiancially supporting another system, which is able to do this. We would like to avoid to be the only club, without highlight videos. Beside we are suppy happy with Veo. Would kind of be forced by the league to use another system without it.",Any news on this? For child safeguarding reasons we are not allowed to share the full game. I make clips (get them approved) then put them together myself into one using clip champ. Its a pain though,"It would be great to have a easy build in content creator. Where you can select highlights, but also can select an intro template (upload team logo’s, final score, weather forcast, starting 11, location etc..) and some templates between the highlights where you can add a short veo overlay (or sponsor to add by the user).",I would like to be able to download the player profile highlights into one file that could be sent to coaches and academies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have a security problem with the cameras. Yesterday I was recording in a tournament at Phoenix Arizona, and it was same people
with Veo cameras, the problem happened two times, first time a person intentionally stopped my camera in the middle of a game and the second one
another person did the same by mistake, my camera hooked in his phone wireless first and he pressed the red dot.
I need to be able to change the password of my cameras.",519⬆ | 1⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 3:20 PM",,,,,Sux they cant fix this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I agree. This happened to me on a futsal game. The other coach was able to access my camera because the cameras share the same password. Can the default password be changed? As Veo is becoming more popular, this is going to be a big mess","How do you change the password on the camera. Had a not so nice person go around and stop recordings, it seems that all units have the same password kickoff!","We had two games going on in a tournament beside each other with two Veo cameras back to back and I accidentally stopped someone else’s recording as I connected to the wrong wifi network! I was very confused as to why I needed to input my password again.
I quickly discovered my error and restarted their recording but I can only imagine how annoying this would have been for the other club after I renamed the first part of their recording with our game team names!!
Accidents wouldn’t happen if we didn’t all have the same wifi passwords with similar access point names!!",Same issue on our side :-(,Would Veo engage in a meeting to discuss ways to implement the security needed for this issue?,I’ve had the same problem with someone else who was recording with a veo camera. They connected to my camera and “accidentally” stopped recording. Very annoying. There should be an option to create a password for your cameras otherwise this problem will keep happening,"HELLLLOOOOOOOOO!!!! What can we do to get this going ASAP? Every WiFi device as well as pretty much every device with a MAC address has the ability to change the default password. Why is this even requiring a post? This is CRAZY to me. I literally can log into any Veo, go into the camera settings and delete their games and stop recording. I’ve had my camera stopped during the middile of a game because the other team was so upset with how the match was going and they didn’t want it recorded. The parent literally said, “Bummer your camera stopped recording, too bad there’s nothing to do about it..” Seriously, this is a huge issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Administrator can click on icon for number of views in a match and see a list of viewers. Perhaps, within the team member section admin could also access a list of each members viewing stats?",483⬆ | 24⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 6:51 AM",,,,,feel like this would be a great addition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This sounds like a good idea. As a coach, if i tell my team to view the video i could track who did and did not. This would only be possible in private mode where the team has signed up for access to the profile. Public is open to everyone (granted a pop-up could be prompted for the email but would probably be optional).","Yes, some analytics for admins / coaches would be helpful.","Yes, Id like to see what user viewed, duration, number of views per user, time, date staped. This information should only be available as an admin",Competitor brands do this. When I used Hudl I could see every player and how long they each spent watching the film. It would be great to have this feature again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mark-ups and drawings can not be currently shown in the clip when you download it. This would be a useful feature.,467⬆ | 16⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 6:46 AM",,,,,Agree…our team was ecstatic about veo. Knowing that we cannot highlight or circle the player for sending videos to coaches is a huge downfall to the product. We will still need to hire or spend the time downloading and editing in a third party product. Confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I would like to be able to download the highlight videos with the drawing features in the video. It is defeats the purpose of creating a highlight with drawing features to share if you can’t share the drawing features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,still no news on this? Surely you can export the drawings/analysis so it can be shared to agents/social media and etc,Unbelieveable that this still isn’t an option to download with drawings/notes. You are requiring players to edit videos in a 3rd party for this feature.,"Agree, would be very usefull for us as well",At least have a board on what features are being worked on - not even sure there is and features being worked on!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe a scrolling ticker at the bottom for multiple sponsors or the ability to have a compay logo added to the recoring in the corner of the match or at the bottom of the screen. Just like there is on Sky and BT.,356⬆ | 20⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 7:26 AM",,,,,As previously noted. This would be critical for fundraising with sponsors. Should be available not only during live stream. Please consider this option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,When it comes?,This would REALLY help our Club afford a Veo. Not sure that we would be able to afford one without it.,For us is essential to see the games recorded automatically with sponsors logo.,This option is already available in a live stream?? Why is this still active?,We are using the overlays on Live now and hoping to draw sponsorships with this feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I love the features of the VEO, but I the video quality isn’t very good. Needs drastic improvement.",303⬆ | 12⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 2:24 PM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is still a problem. I was surprised when I got my Veo Cam 2 that the output resolution is still the same :( The fact that the Cam 2 is marketed as a higher quality version of the camera has me very disappointed in my purchase of a Veo Cam 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Something with more dynamic range that can adjust to lighting conditions during the game would be great as well.,I find the ability to adjust to lighting conditions is a big challenge for the teams I work with if we have games in a stadium/pitch where where there is a stand that casts a shadow over part of the field the Veo contrast for players in part of the field outside of the shadow can’t be distinguished due to the oversaturation or contrast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be beneficial to be able to highlight the person or movements in the directed highlights. If you had the draw feature available there it would help illustrate what options the players have when reviewing the film.,292⬆ | 11⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 6:40 AM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Maybe a spotlight feature similiar in video editing products.,"This came up long time ago and I think is a very important feature. Especially when you need to zoom out in a highlight by using interactive view to see all relevant players and you then want to draw in the highlight, this is not possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Add wind / noise reduction “muff” or such adapted for the Veo microphone holes to the Veo-kit (or try to find/adjust what in the design of the Veo that creates the wind noise if a “muff” won´t solve the issue).
edit - another solution which I suggested in another submission would be to add the possibility to connect an external microphone that could have better wind/noise reduction and also give the possibility of a live commentator to a game",269⬆ | 15⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 6:59 AM",,,,,How is it possible in today’s world to have a great camera with such a piss poor microphone? Wind absolutely kills the experience from audio….is so loud i actually have to mute it…….and while at the game i did not notice wind…….so i am regularly shocked in a bad the wind noise is. VEO—-DO SOMETHING!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We’ve had some success with using a wind Muff for small digital cameras (Similar to the amazon link above). On really windy days we still do get some noise but it is much better overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wind noise greatly diminishes the audio and video experience. Fist two games recorded the wind was 5-10mph resulting in not hearing coaches instructions during scrimmage or players communicating. I like the idea of a better mic as an accessory plus just adding wind dampening to veo’s mics. I assume they have zero dampening now.,I found some “muffs” for a gopro. Going to give them a try. They attach over the pinholes.,Another option: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SL11LZB/,My son plays on two teams that use VEO. Both teams frequently have recordings where there is slight wind at times and those times the audio is unusable or very loud and unpleasant. I would recommend including a windscreen of some sort in future iterations or a windscreen add on for existing models. Just sounds horrible and is frustrating to use when there is wind.,I suggest using post-processing to remove the wind noise. Look at solutions like Krisp that work like magic to remove background noise and isolate voice.,wind jammer rycote probleem opgelost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It would be nice if there woul be an easier way to upload a compressed file on Youtube or be able to share the videos there.,267⬆ | 0⬇,"Sep 20, 2020 2:39 PM",,,,,It would be nice to be able to put in a stream key to other websites so the stream that the camera is picking up can be viewed on those,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,How do you do this ? Sorry!!,"@Anders Schäffner that’s unfortunate, but thanks for the update.
Brad","Kind regards
Anders - Product Manager @ Veo",YouTube and other social media platforms are so valuable to teams and individual players in todays environment that it seems Veo would be interested in getting those streaming sources connected. The more viewing Veo footage across multiple platforms would be addional advertisement for the product and services offered.,"broadcast live through youtube, twitch, tiktok and other platforms. Veo live app is a very limited application when it comes to searches, and the procedures to register make many people give up watching live shows. Other similar companies like pixellot, avmedia… the live broadcasts are owned by the broadcaster and can be used freely.","You’ve probably already seen these new streaming destinations in app.veo.co, but in case you’ve missed it, here’s a handy guide on how to add these channels:

‘Would love the ability to add voiceover to videos for analysis.’,261⬆ | 15⬇,"Sep 18, 2020 1:20 PM",,,,,Three years ago this was changed to under consideration and it’s still under consideration?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This would definitely help as trying to describe things in the highlights comment section normally isn’t enough space to articulate things in the same way a voice comment could provide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This would be an incredible addition to the veo platform. Being able to walk your players through clips so you can share all of your thoughts. Sometimes you just need to convey more information to your players. Would love to see this feature.,"Totally agree, As a coach for over 20y this would benefit me and my team enormously. It can be done on a normal video editing tool, but then a download of the veo video is needed and upload again","Veo admins, any updates on this for Veo 3?",Has anyone tried connecting a BT speaker next to the camera where a live commentator can inject audio to the stream?,,,,,,,,
Could we add lens that fit over the camera already allowing to zoom over closer to set pieces or see more on the opposite side of the pitch ?,221⬆ | 18⬇,"Sep 22, 2020 7:01 AM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Would like this option, or ability to fixate camera for penalty shoot out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,@Kawus Nouri Sounds great it is planned - but would it be with an ekstra lens or just buffing up resolution. I guess we record in 4K?,"I think we don’t need 4K to watch way the grass is blowing HD is enough saying that I think the lens like specs to increase the zoom would make a big difference in Quality as you view the action on the other side of the pitch.
The veo is still a young product so all this chat may help it get better over the years & try keep the cost right to buy add ons",I’d love to be able to use veo to watch a game as tactical angle which is zoomed out to see as much of the play as possible - particularly when using stadium mount or the taller tripod :-),What would be nice is to set a default zoom preference in the veo app that is used when rendering uploaded videos for the “follow the ball” view. The coaches like it zoomed out for tactical analysis; players like it zoomed in for pulling highlights. Being able to set a knob between two extremes that you can adjust for your team’s preferences would be great.,The Veo is wonderful for set and forget.,,,
"Sometimes two teams from the same club are playing each other. In those cases we would like to have the same recording available in both teams, and preferably with its own team specific analysis",220⬆ | 6⬇,"Sep 16, 2020 10:40 AM",,,,,Please consider this! Would be massive for coach development at our club since we play multiple friendlies. Thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I used the share with opponent. That way I manged to get the video in both my teams.,Needed enhancement. Our club has more than one team playing in the same league and are always hosting in-house scrimmages against our club teams.,"We had a infra club game and we want to keep the film private, but share film with bith teams. Please implement this."
